# Create an HTML File

First of all: **Congratulations** for reaching this point. Keep the vibes and get ready for the next step.  

Create an HTML file named hello-world.html with the following content:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20em">
    <h2>My Hello World JavaScript Function</h2>

    <button type="button" onclick="doIt()">
      Click Me
    </button>

    <script src="hello-world.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```
