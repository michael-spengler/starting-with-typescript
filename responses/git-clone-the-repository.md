# Git Clone the Repository and Create an HTML File in the Corresponding Folder

First of all: **Congratulations** for reaching this point. Keep the vibes and get ready for the next step.  

Clone the current repository  
```git clone <replace this with your current repository>``` in a terminal / console / git bash

Open the folder which contains this repository now in Visual Studio Code and create a simple html file in there.

If you got stuck in this step please reach out to a friend who uses the same operating system as you or to the author of this course.
