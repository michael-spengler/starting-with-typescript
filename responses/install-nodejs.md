# Install NodeJS

You can download and install Git from this link: https://nodejs.org/en/. 

This will automatically also install the Node Package Manager (NPM). 

After the installation check whether the installation was successful. You can do this by:

1. checking the node version by entering ```node -v``` in a terminal / console / git bash
2. checking the npm version by entering ```npm -v```

If you got stuck in this step please reach out to a friend or to the author of this course.
