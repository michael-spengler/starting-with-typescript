# Install NodeJS

First of all: **Congratulations** for reaching this point. Keep the vibes and get ready for the next step.  

You can download and install Git from this link: https://nodejs.org/. 

This will automatically also install the Node Package Manager (NPM). 

After the installation check whether the installation was successful. You can do this by:

1. checking the node version by entering ```node -v``` in a terminal / console / git bash
2. checking the npm version by entering ```npm -v```

If you got stuck in this step please reach out to a friend who uses the same operating system as you or to the author of this course.
