# Install Git

You can download and install Git from this link: https://git-scm.com/downloads

After the installation check whether the installation was successful. You can do this by:

1. checking the git version by typing git -v in a terminal / console / git bash

If your terminal / console / git bash responds with a reasonable version number you succeeded in this step. Feel free to close this issue in this case.

If you got stuck in this step please reach out to a friend or to the author of this course.
