# Install Git

First of all: **Congratulations** for reaching this point. Keep the vibes and get ready for the next step.  

You can download and install Git from this link: https://git-scm.com/downloads

After the installation check whether the installation was successful. You can do this by checking the git version by entering ```git --version``` in a terminal / console / git bash

If your terminal / console / git bash responds with a reasonable version number you succeeded in this step. Feel free to close this issue in this case.

If you got stuck in this step please reach out to a friend who uses the same operating system as you or to the author of this course.
